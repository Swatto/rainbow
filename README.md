## Configuration

You can configure your super rainbow : his saturation and lightness.
You have two possibilites :

- Add `data-saturation` or|and `data-lightness` to your DOM element

```html
<h2 class="rainbow" data-saturation="40%" data-lightness="80%">Config Rainbow</h2>
```


- Add the configuration object as a second params

```js
var subTitle = document.querySelector('h2.title');
Rainbow(subTitle, {
  saturation: '40%',
  lightness: '80%'
  });
```

NB: if both are set, the configuration object will have the priority.
